# MiaHelps: Emotional Support Service through Stories and Artificial Intelligence

MiaHelps is a web service that allows users to share their emotional stories, receive responses and advice from artificial intelligence (Chat GPT), and, if desired, interact with therapists through a Telegram chatbot.

## Description of the Process

### Step 1: Platform Entry

Users visit the MiaHelps website at [http://miahelps.com/form](http://miahelps.com/form), where the process of submitting their story begins.

### Step 2: Choosing Questions

On the form page, users are presented with the option to choose from the following questions:

a. **What is your biggest regret?**
b. **Who was your greatest love and why did you fall in love with them?**
c. **The words that hurt you the most**
d. **How are you? (Just be honest)**
e. **Write a letter that he/she will never read.**
f. **Other**

### Step 3: Story Submission

Users write their stories, infusing them with their emotions and reflections. The time users typically spend on writing a story is approximately 5 minutes. After composing the story, users click the "Submit" button.

### Step 4: Interaction with Chat GPT

The user's story is sent for processing and analysis to the artificial intelligence - Chat GPT. As a result of this processing, users receive a response from Chat GPT, including advice, psychological support, and reflections based on their story.

### Step 5: Contact Information and Access to the Response

After receiving a response from Chat GPT, users are redirected to page 2, where they have the option to leave their email address. This facilitates easier identification of users for future interactions. If users choose not to provide their email address, their data is not stored in the database.

### Step 6: Displaying the Response and Additional Options

On page 3, users are provided with the opportunity to read the response from Chat GPT regarding their story. After reading the response, users can proceed to additional options:

- Connecting to the Telegram chatbot: If users have Telegram, they can connect to the chatbot for further communication and support.
- Entering an email address: If users do not use Telegram, they can enter their email address to receive instructions on how to install Telegram and connect to the chatbot.

### Chatbot

The chatbot offers three modes of interaction:

1. **Consultation:** Users can receive general advice and support from Chat GPT.
2. **Current Experience:** Users can share their current experiences and issues, receiving support and reflections in response.
3. **Therapist Subscription:** For an additional fee, users gain access to asking questions to a therapist and engaging in weekly conversations, receiving comments and advice.

### Database

A database entry is created for each user, storing their email address, story, and response from Chat GPT. If users do not provide an email address on page 2, no data is stored.

MiaHelps is a platform designed to provide emotional support, analysis, and advice based on personal stories, as well as the opportunity to interact with therapists through a user-friendly chatbot on Telegram.
